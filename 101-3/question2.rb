# ! is conventionally used at the end of methods which mutate the caller. It also is used in different situations, generally to mean that the value of something is now it's opposite.
# ? is conventionally used at the end of methods which evaluate to true or false. It is also a thing called the ternary operator. This can be used in the following way: "statement ? if true : if false"

# 1. '!=' means 'not equals'. If you want to check if two objects are not equivalent.
# 2. '!' Will invert a boolean value. If user_name is true (or truthy), then it will evaluate to false.
# 3. will (often) call a version of the method that mutates the caller.
# 4. Don't understand the question (ternary operator?)
# 5. denotes a method that evaluates to true or false
# 6. '!!' inverts a boolean value twice. So '!!true' evalulates to 'true'
