# *Inputs*
# loan amount
# annual percentage rate
# loan duration

# *Outputs*
# Monthly interest rate
# Loan duration in months

# m = p * ( j / (1 - ( 1 + j ) ** (-n)))

# m = monthly payment
# p = loan amount
# j = monthly interest rate
# n = loan duration in months

# *Assumptions*
# Initial loan duration set in years
# Initial interest rate also annual
# Need to convert these into monthly figures
# interest rates should be in decimals (ie floats)

# *High Level Pseudocode*
# Ask for user to input different elements
# - loan amount
# - APR
# - years of loan
# Convert APR and years of loan to j and n
# Calculate m from formula

# *Detailed Pseudocode
# START

#   PRINT 'What annual interest rate have you been quoted? Please enter '
#   GET and SET apr
