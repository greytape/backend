=begin
- equility operator is(what kind of method it is and what is comparing). You will also need to check is there custom equality
operator in some other classes like String, Integer class and what it is doing there

- relationship between classes and objects

- inheritance, know to explain it, provide examples. What are cons in Ruby of inheritance, what you can't do.
Provide examples and explain how can you solve that problem.

- Know what polymorphism is and explain it with code.

You need to know theory well, so learn what are the advantages of OOP, what are cons of it.

- What is the Object Oriented Design?

And prepare that the last question in the quiz will be a long one, I took probably 40 minutes for it.

Have examples for certain concepts prepared
