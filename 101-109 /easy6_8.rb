# # I/O

# input: array
# output: integer

# # Logic

# - initialise an empty hash with 0 as default value
# - iterate through the array, adding each element to the hash as a key
# - increment the value of that key by 1
# - return the key for the value of the hash that is 2

# #Â Methods

# array#-
# array#uniq

# # Code

def find_dup(arr)
  hsh = Hash.new(0)
  arr.each { |e| hsh[e] += 1}
  hsh.key(2)
end
