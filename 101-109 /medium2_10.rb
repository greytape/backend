# #Â Problem

# - difference between square of sum of first n integers
# - and sum of square of first n integers

# # I/O

# input: integer
# output: integer

# # Logic

# - initialise two values, sum of squares, square of sum, at zero
# - iterate through range from zero to input number
# - add square of value to sum of squares
# - add value to square of sum
# - square square of sum
# - return difference between sum of squares and square of sum

# # Methods

# integer#upto

# # Code
